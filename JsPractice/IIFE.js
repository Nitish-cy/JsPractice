// Imidiate Invoked function Expression
// IIFE stands for "Immediately Invoked Function Expression."
//  It's a common design pattern in JavaScript that involves defining and 
//  immediately executing a function. The purpose of using an IIFE is 
// to create a private scope for your code and to avoid polluting the global namespace with variables.
